Last night I spent sometime to understand on the Volume Price Analysis by Anna Coulling. The initial pages of book is very dragging for me. The information is mostly reptitive to stress the importance of Volume with price action trading. I am now taking time to digest the information and process it. As I moved onto chapter 1 and certain principles such as effort vs result and concepts such as volume vs ticks (as in forex) are fairly new. I really like the analogy given for the patience principle. I am sure most traders are stuck at such phase just like I did.

I will continue to progress the book today. I spent most time in setting up this site today, though it wasted much of my time, but I believe it will help me keep streamlined and documented.

I did not look into any of the forex chart so far. It is sometimes tempting to see the chart and trade for small wins. But in trading, unlike any other profession, small wins will haste your decision process and lead to loss. So I want to get out of that cycle. Though I will check the charts to understand the market, I will definitely not place trade.
