Reading through the Volume Price analysis book is difficult, particularly when a book is influenced from another book, my mind is constantly trying to understand the reference book, which is 'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre'. So I thought to check that book yesterday. I started the book without reading any reviews. Usually, I read reviews about the book to understand what that book is about. But this time, I thought let's just take it and start reading it, since it is referred by Anna Coulling frequently.

As I started reading the book, I came to understand that it is not a regular technical book for stock market or any other market book which helps understand current market or psychology behind the market. This book is more a story of a stock market operator who had his own ups and downs in the market. Usually I avoid such story/novel for reasons, that it might not help real world scenario. I have read only one novel so far, which is 'Ponniyin Selvan', but let us take it up on another day.

Coming back to 'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator', I felt this book is very important as I was going to complete chapter 2. Usually every trader in stock market who either want to make it big at one shot or get regular income, have their own understanding of the market and they simply fail for the same reasons. Here Larry Livingston, who is a stock operator by age 14 is helping the reader to understand a trader's life cycle in a stock market. When I say life cycle, a trader may earn very good profit during his initial days and then run into major loss and may come back to profit again or quit the market, whatever the phase he may be in, Larry Livingston or Jesse Livermore explains the same in 3rd person view and 1st person view to put a picture together in our mind that we as a trader might also face the same. A trader cannot avoid such situations, just like in real life where we cannot avoid some unforeseen situation, but the books let us understand that how a trader can manage and still make good profit without giving to the action behind every trade.

After going through the book in the initial chapters, I felt like I now understand Anna Coulling and why she kept referring Jesse Livermore in her book through out. I always like the idea of setting up a process with details and let alone execute the same without any intervention. Like I stated in my earlier post [here](https://vicky1408.github.io/v/blog/trading-day-1/)

> My vision of trading is to look for potential opportunities and apply the same with strategy or plan in place. Let my strategy execute, whether it hits stop loss or take profit, in both these cases, I need to be very much aligned with my strategy and discipline. If it hits stop loss, I need to correct my review and correct my strategy.

Like it is mentioned in the book, no trader can be successful throughout the trades he have placed. The trend is tend be repeated, If a trader can get 7 out of 10 trades as win, he will achieve good profit. I would like to stick myself the same, where my strategy will help land on the 7 out of 10 trade win.
