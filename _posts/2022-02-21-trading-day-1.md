This happened over a period of time from the past 3 weeks. Since I started my dedicated trading journal now, I am publishing details here by consolidating and posting details now.

Completed 90% Candlestick Bible book by munehisa homma. The book is very much useful which helped me to understand candlestick patterns and based on that knowledge I immediately started my trading in Forex market with $100. Initially, I was very much confident and got upto 2% returns(i.e $2), but then again the profit was lost in consecutive trades. I am now back to original $100. 

I understand now I do not have a proper trading system or trading strategy to execute my trades. I was simply gambling due to greediness. Now I want to discipline myself and understand the market first. 

My vision of trading is to look for potential opportunities and apply the same with strategy or plan in place. Let my strategy execute, whether it hits stop loss or take profit, in both these cases, I need to be very much aligned with my strategy and discipline. If it hits stop loss, I need to correct my review and correct my strategy. But I do not want to take any trades now, atleast until April 01 2022. I want to understand the market first and build the strategy/discipline with backtest and then start with real time trading.

Now I have started another book, Volume Price Analysis by Anna Coulling. So far, 20% of book is completed. I started to understand the perspective of Volume along with price action now. I will continue with this book and learning. Also, I need to go through Candlestick bible once again, because re-reading a completed book will help absorb the crux and details of the book and permanently place the idea in my mind.
